# Browser-based-models-with-TensorFlow.js

This repository was created based on "Browser-based models with TensorFlow.js" course, by Coursera, (available at this link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/browser-based-models-tensorflow?).
It was quite amazing to see machine learning models, running in the browser :)

The files in the repository are separated into 4 weeks, according to the Coursera course, mentioned above.  Every week contains Examples, to learn from, and Exercises, 
to implement, based on those examples.
Simple HTML Editor (e.g. Brackets, etc. ) required for working with the exercises, however one task will require Jupyter Notebook.

The course material is nicely structured and explained, and it's a fun to learn TensorFlow.js :)!

Can only recommend!
