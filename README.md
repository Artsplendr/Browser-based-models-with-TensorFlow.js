# Browser-based-models-with-TensorFlow.js

This repository was created based on "Browser-based models with TensorFlow.js" course by Coursera, available at this link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/browser-based-models-tensorflow?.
It was quite amazing to see machine learning models, running in the browser :)

The files in the repository are separated into 4 weeks, according to the Coursera course.  Every week contains Examples, to learn from, and Exercises, to implement, based on the examples.
Simple HTML Editor (e.g. Brackets, etc. ) is required for working on the exercises and on one assignment.

The course material is nicely structured and explained, and it was a fun to learn TensorFlow.js :)!
